Goal1: How to load the data into python using pandas

Goal2: Generate scatter plot correlating the CRISPR KO effect vs Gene expression

Goal3: How to systematically screen for this of relationship

Goal4: How to develop a machine learning model to identify gene expression predictive of the CRISPR effect

Goal5: How to identify synergistic effects (this is a big area with significant pharmaceutical interest)
